### Purpose

Investigative Dashboard (ID) is intended to help investigative journalists to
do their work in a fast and effective way. It combines a number of software
tools, including search engines, databases, a research support system and a
file manager, to try to shorten the lead time from story inception to
publication.

### About OCCRP

The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) is a
not-for-profit, joint program of a number of regional non-profit investigative
centers and for profit independent media stretching from Eastern Europe to
Central Asia.

Our goal is to help the people of the region better understand how organized
crime and corruption affect their lives. OCCRP seeks to provide in-depth
investigative stories as well as the latest news pertaining to organized crime
and corruption activities in the region. In addition to the stories, OCCRP is
building an online resource center of documents related to organized crime
including court records, laws, reports, studies, company records and other
public documents that will be an invaluable resource center for journalists and
the public alike.
