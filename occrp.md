Investigative Dashboard (ID) has been developed by the Organized Crime and
Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), the world’s leading cross border
investigative reporting organization. OCCRP designed Investigative Dashboard as
a transnational collaborative effort to help journalists and civil society
researchers expose organized crime and corruption around the world. It hosts
three core tools: a crowd-sourced database of information and documents on
persons of interest and their business connections, a worldwide list of online
databases and business registries, and a research desk where journalists can go
for help in sourcing hard to find information.

With help from dozens of reporters and civic hackers, ID researchers have
created the crowd-sourced database where connections of people and business can
be mapped internationally. Through collecting public records worldwide in
numerous languages and by scraping the business registries and official
gazettes of countries such as Panama, British Virgin Islands, and Luxembourg
among others we have made data searchable and hence truly transparent and
useful. These resources are offered to the public as a searchable self-serve
repository of data and documents.

The Investigative Dashboard also links to more than 400 online databases in 120
jurisdictions where you can search for information on persons and businesses of
interest.

Above and beyond the databases available on the Dashboard, the research desk
provides access to a global network of expert researchers. Journalists and
researchers working on organized crime and corruption topics who seek
information and documents beyond their own borders and resources are invited to
request the expertise of a network of information professionals. These
professionals can access external databases and official filings for evidence
of corporate ownership and property holdings that cross borders. For some
journalists, these services are provided pro bono.

Journalists have used the Investigative Dashboard to work on stories that have
won more than a dozen international awards, led to indictments, arrests and
seizures, forced the resignation of heads of state, and exposed the activities
of organized crime.

Foundations with additional assistance from USAID.

## Partners

The Research Desk is managed by OCCRP in co-operation with four partner
Centers - African Network of Centers for Investigative Reporting (ANCIR), the
Arab Reporters for Investigative Journalism (ARIJ), the International Center
for Journalists, and Connectas in the Americas.

## ID History

The Investigative Dashboard was developed by Paul Cristian Radu (OCCRP) and
Justin Arenstein (ANCIR) while they both were in residence at Stanford
University as Knight Fellows. The John S. Knight Fellowships for Professional
Journalists made the dashboard possible by providing access to the know-how of
fellow journalists and of experts at Stanford University and in Silicon Valley.
