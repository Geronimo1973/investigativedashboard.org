Lejla Čamdžić joined the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) network in Sarajevo in 2011 and quickly became the organization’s premier researcher. She currently operates as the head of research at OCCRP.

In addition to her research duties, Čamdžić is responsible for guiding the development of the Investigative Dashboard platform – part of an international, collaborative effort aimed at helping reporters and civil society organizations around the world to research businesses and people in a variety of countries, accessing and interpreting different kinds of records.

Čamdžić has helped journalists across the globe - from media startups in the developing world, to the most prominent newsrooms - uncover critical information and confirm key facts. She has held numerous workshops and trainings on how to conduct cross-border investigations, find and use various types of records in jurisdictions worldwide, use commercial databases and look into offshore companies.

In her time at OCCRP, Čamdžić has been an integral part of large-scale investigative projects, including Panama Papers and Paradise Papers. She has also provided support to regional editors on other major corruption and organized crime investigations, such as “Making a Killing,” “Unholy Alliances,” and the network’s series on TeliaSonera’s dealings with the first families of Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan.

Čamdžić served as the organization’s lead fact-checker for five years.
